<h2 id="oak-hammock-with-the-boys-during-fall-migration">Oak Hammock with the boys during fall migration</h2>

<p>To the north strings of Snow Geese fill the early morning horizon. They descend, exhausted, after the long night’s flight. A distant shot rings out. Hundreds rise in shifting eddies and swirls, sparkling in the sun like snow flurries on a windy day.</p>

<p>The willows are filled with warblers; their fall plumage of soft green, brown, gray and yellow feathers blends perfectly with the yellowing and browning leaves. We saw them everywhere on the way to the marsh – on telephone wires, in aspens and on cropped fields. Hungry, after a night’s flight of perhaps two hundred miles, they’re searching for grubs, insect eggs and cocoons.</p>

<p>Six Common Ravens fly by. Hundreds of Yellow-headed Blackbirds flock overhead on their way to Mexico.</p>

<p>The shorebirds are back: Plovers and Sandpipers forage in mud and grass for insects, worms and crustaceans. As with the warblers a winter plumage of duller, more neutral colours have replaced spring’s bright breeding plumage. They’re harder to identify now.</p>

<p>The boys and I are here to see the fall marsh filled with birds back from breeding grounds in the northern forests and tundra, ready to rest and feed before resuming their journey south. There’s been a great change in the past few weeks. The trees along our way were no longer green but brown, yellow, purple and russet. Green has disappeared from most marsh plants; frail, dry phragmites are now the colour of sand.</p>

<p>There are birds everywhere – probing the mud shores and spilling out over the adjoining stubble fields. It’s a magic day. We’re grateful for the perfection of the sun, the warmth, and the beauty of the marsh stretching out on each side of the dike.</p>

<p>Once out of the car the boys still head first for the observation mounds, race up and down, and then to the dikes, to draw letters and names in the dirt. They play tag in muskrat passages in cattails and catch a glimpse of a muskrat’s brown head and back, swimming away towards the centre of the marsh. We look for signs of muskrat winter preparations: houses of bulrushes and cattails plastered over with mud and pondweeds; or muskrat pushups, domes of vegetation reached underwater for winter feeding.</p>

<p>Cows and horses, pastured in marsh fields, plod silently along the dike road and block our way. A ground squirrel stands up on hind legs and peers at us, then disappears into its burrow running under the road.</p>

<p>The thousands of Canada Geese spread out over the fields challenge the boys; they charge toward a flock and the geese scatter. Running back they just catch sight of a Northern Harrier plummeting down on an isolated Green-winged Teal feeding in the dike water. At the last minute the teal disappears underwater and the harrier flashes over the empty surface, flies up, and soaring, scans the marsh again.</p>

<p>High water from spring flooding still laps around willows in the southern slough. They’ve sprouted red secondary roots just above the water’s surface, a strategy to prevent drowning. Growing roots won’t save them – they won’t last another year under these conditions. The slough will have to be drained.</p>

<p>Periodically each marsh compartment is drained to simulate the dry/flood cycle of an undisturbed marsh. The dry periods provide an opportunity for oxygenation of the bottom muck and release of nutrients. Later, seeds on the bottom sprout, providing new emergent vegetation when the marsh is reflooded. This process, called drawdown, is part of marsh management for stability and diversity of habitat for different birds’ needs. Drawdown ensures a balance of open water and islands: open water and emergent vegetation for food; and islands for nesting and shelter.</p>

<p>A crew from the marsh management authority comes by in a shallow-bottomed amphibious boat. They have two sick ducks, a Pintail that can’t hold up its head and a Shoveller, head shaking constantly. These men have the unpleasant job of clearing the marsh of dead, sick and dying ducks, all victims of botulism, a disease that attacks the central nervous system. It’s passed up the food chain, becoming more concentrated at each step, from small invertebrates to ducks and then to ravens and crows feeding on dead ducks. These birds are on their way to an animal hospital with fresh water and may recover.</p>

<p>A shot rings out in the distance. We see a goose separate from its string and fly down. Perhaps a goose we didn’t see was shot and its mate followed it. On the dike ahead of us a Canada Goose calls, its broken wing twisted vertically. Another walks on the dike a few feet away, tries to fly but fails. It rests in the grasses at the edge of the road. Both were likely shot in distant fields and made their way back to this protected marsh.</p>

<p>The boys are frightened by the gunshots and upset that these geese are hurt. They keep asking why men want to shoot geese, and I have little to say, except that we like watching birds and some men like hunting them, as they have for centuries.</p>



<h2 id="alexs-bad-dream">Alex’s bad dream</h2>

<p>Alex woke last night, crying. In his dream hunters were coming for him with their guns and he was frightened. We talked for a while and then he went back to sleep, having decided in his next dream to take the hunters’ guns away and tell them not to hurt the geese. Then, the next day, he’d give the guns back, as presents.</p>

<p>He is more generous than I am. I get angry seeing injured birds. Yet most hunters are responsible people whose love of hunting brings intimacy with the environment and a respect for the ways of wild things. Hunters have been leaders in the fight for conservation of wildlife and protection of endangered species.</p>

<p>Except for particular species, the real danger to wildlife now lies not with hunting but with the loss of habitat, and with the destruction of the environment from pollution and industrial spillage of chemicals and poisons. It’s important to keep that in focus.</p>



<h2 id="plains-cree-and-assiniboine-in-autumn">Plains Cree and Assiniboine in autumn</h2>

<p>Golden aspen leaves trickling down to layer misty hollows found deserted summer fishing villages. Woodland people had dispersed in small family groups to garner whatever resources might be dried and saved against winter’s sparse hunting.</p>

<p>The last of summer’s blueberries, chokecherries and Saskatoons had been dried and stored; bearberry leaves collected for kinnikinnick, roots dug and herbs gathered for teas and poultices.</p>

<p>Women had rolled and packed the sheets of birch bark used for summer lodges into canoes laden with summer-smoked fish and fish oil in skin bags, with cooking pots, clothes, tools, and lodge furnishings.</p>

<p>Families now are harvesting wild rice. Men paddle canoes through shallows thick with rice plants as women hold long wands of rice stalks over the gunwales with one stick, and flail the grains loose from their stems with another. They store the parched rice (husked by stamping and winnowing when thrown into a stiff wind) in fawn skin bags, load their canoes again, and move to new food sources.</p>

<p>Whitefish migrating downstream are diverted onto shores by willow fence traps. Summer-fattened muskrat and beaver, fox and wolf, are prized now when their luxuriant pelts are in prime condition. Grouse and partridge struggle in snares. Pintails, Mallards, Canada Geese and Whistling Swans plummet, shot by hunters crouched in the bows of canoes women paddle silently along marsh edges and lake shores. Ceremonies honour the animal spirits that provide people with food, and bring the visions that promise skill and luck in the hunt.</p>

<p>After fall bison hunts, Plains Assiniboine traveled south to trade for corn from the Mandan people. Then, when cold winds and snow swept across the open prairie they traveled north again, following bison and elk into the shelter of wooded parkland edges. Like the woodland people they scatter here; to trap wolf and fox and to hunt moose, elk and bison, increasingly vulnerable as the heavy animals flounder in snow drifts.</p>

<p>Our outlook on our environment is very different. We city people walk these forests now for pleasure. They walked knowing there was no food but what could be garnered, daily, from forest and lakes. Their spiritual sense included their entire environment: the land, the waters, plants and animals and their fellow human beings. Our spiritual sense often sees us as masters of our environment. This is changing as we understand more clearly our interconnection with our environment and our impact on it.</p>



<h2 id="critical-habitats-and-fall-migration-at-fortwhyte-alive">Critical habitats and fall migration at FortWhyte Alive</h2>

<p>As we came to FortWhyte Alive during the spring nesting season, so we’ve come back in the fall in the midst of duck and geese migration. Flocks have been coming through here since early September. Today a small flock of Goldeneye mix with Bufflehead, and a stray Oldsquaw floats nearby.</p>

<p>It’s chilly today. A sharp wind lifts clumps of dogbane seeds from the edges of long pods and casts them over the meadow. Each narrow seed hangs from a silky parachute. Some cling to goldenrod, whose stiff stems bulge with wasp and fly galls.</p>

<p>The meadows and lakes form a familiar pattern now for many migrating birds. Ducks started gathering weeks ago; drawn from sloughs, marshes and lakes like filings drawn to a magnet, until large flocks have collected ready for migration. Males gather from bachelor flocks after molting from their drab summer eclipse plumage into a bright breeding plumage. Females gather: females who’ve left their self-sufficient young and withdrawn to molt flight feathers. Ducklings, grown and fattened, form flocks of young birds, often the first to leave. Certain species, like the Redheads and Ringnecks close to shore here, may flock together.</p>

<p>It isn’t known for certain how birds choose the exact moment to renew a flight after a resting period. Today an open sky permits them to see landmarks, and there’s a strong tail wind. We’re looking for any sounds, or shakings of the head, which might signal take-off, but the ducks stay put, calmly feeding.</p>

<p>In flight, whistling wings and the quacks and peeps specific to each flock keep the birds in touch, keeping the flock together. Ducks blown off course look for another flock rather than attempt the journey alone.</p>

<p>To understand migratory patterns scientists return year after year to examine and band birds at resting areas. From this they’ve established the existence of huge “flyways” for ducks and geese. These broad geographic areas comprise their winter and summer grounds and the areas traveled to reach those grounds. Most of the birds which touch down here at the Centre are following the Mississippi flyway. Most will winter on the Gulf Coast, or in Missouri or Iowa.</p>

<p>Ornithologists have learned as well that birds follow specific migratory routes: rivers and lakeshores, or railway lines and highways. Perhaps the knowledge is inherited. Tradition is also a factor, although bird adapt to learn the location of new marshes and grain fields, returning annually.</p>

<p>Last week on the shore of Lake Manitoba we watched goose parents patiently encouraging a young goose to fly. It couldn’t get off the water. The parents would likely stay close by, continuing their efforts until freezing weather forced their departure. Then the young bird, without their protection, weakened from increasing difficulty in finding food and trapped by encroaching ice, would fall prey to fox or raccoon.</p>

<p>Birds are left behind: birds which are old, sick, maimed or wounded, those without strength for the flight. If feeding conditions are poor in summer and autumn many can’t obtain sufficient food to fuel a long journey.</p>

<p>The birds migrate to escape one threat, difficulty in finding food under winter conditions, but face new hazards on the way. Animal predators, human hunters, birds of prey haunt the migratory route. As suburbs, factories and highways push into farmland or brush, forest or tundra many resting, feeding and breeding areas are lost. Many small losses add up in a dramatic manner. Birds no longer appear where once they were plentiful.</p>

<p>Fear of the disappearance of whole species has led to the concept of “critical habitats” – tracts of land and water that are vital to the survival of certain species of mammals, birds and fish at certain times of the year. Barren Land Caribou, for example, which were dispersed in summer in smaller bands, gather at staging areas in the Arctic tundra, to move in vast herds of fifty to a hundred thousand to winter feeding grounds in the boreal forest. They face extinction if these routes are endangered.</p>

<p>We have a long history of protecting wildlife. We started with setting aside wilderness parks, protecting endangered species, limiting hunting seasons and setting bag limits. We negotiated international treaties with the United States and Mexico to protect migratory birds. But over the last decades as our knowledge of ecology has grown at the same time as our alarm over the loss of so many habitats, we now see the need to protect valued habitats.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p>Our goal is to preserve living processes in complex plant and animal communities. <br>
Life on the planet can’t survive, with poisons and pollutants released in a continuous stream into soil, water and air. <br>
We can succeed in combating climate change.</p>

<h2 id="the-end-of-autumn">The end of autumn</h2>

<p>We meet at the south mound for the last birding trip to Oak Hammock. At eight o’clock there’s just enough light to pick out a Great Blue Heron stalking the shallows. In the distance an American Bittern flies above lush grasses misted so heavily they seem to be banks of mosses.</p>

<p>A soft gray frost covers the bare fields where the last Snow Geese forage for kernels of grain. Lapland Longspur and Snow buntings fly up to cluster briefly in the willow bluff. The water’s been pumped out to save the willows. Moss-covered roots and stagnant pools give off the heavy odour of decay.</p>

<p>We’re stamping our feet on the hard ground and slapping our arms to stimulate warmth, grateful for mid-morning sunlight breaking through heavy cloud, rimming dike banks – lighting goldenrod and the feathery tops of ash-blond phragmites.</p>

<p>It’s a relief to get in the cars again. It’s turned colder; cold northern air sweeps down past coniferous forests and onto the plain. The first sleet gusts down on steel blue water … dry reeds and grasses sound in the wind.</p>



<h2 id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>

<p>I look back now over the past four years, wondering what all this has meant for me, and what it’s meant for the boys.</p>

<p>For me it’s both an end and a beginning. It’s an end because it’s time for this intense focus to be over and for me to go on to something else. But it’s a beginning, too, for now I feel I have established a foundation: I have some sense for how to look for clues to plant and animal life, and for living communities reacting in their environment.</p>

<p>A lot of emotions flow back with my memories. I remember peacefulness with Paul and the boys at the water’s edge at sunset. Far away, cloud banks glowed in a golden haze; shaded to pink and mauve. Waves surged, ebbed, slapped at boulders and slid over algae-covered rocks.</p>

<p>I remember anxiety as I clutched at Alex’s bottom while he hung over the footbridge peering at fish; dread as he clambered over slopes of moss and pine needles on the cliff high above the bay. I remember sultry summer days when irritation rose from every pore until, far away from the house and out to the park near water, our spirits lifted and calmed, and we were all right again. Then an image of Tom appears, Tom with daisies sprouting out of his pockets, clutching a flashlight with one hand and a container with a restless grasshopper in the other, striding along a forest path determined to find raccoons.</p>

<p>I think of the changes in the boys even though they’re still so young: for example changes in their awareness of birds. Tom is openly enthusiastic. Alex hates any pressure to learn but he’s taken in a lot in ways that weren’t noticeable, and done a lot of thinking. On our last trip home from the cottage he studied a log boom by the pulp mill in Keewatin, outside Kenora, and asked if I liked birds. I said “Yes”. He responded that I should be angry because now that those trees were cut down the birds had no place to go.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION</p>

<p>Family picture</p>

<p>People ask me how the boys learned – what I did that made a difference. I think it was that when I found some little creature that intrigued and excited me, I wanted to share it with them and so I called them over. Sometimes they thought it was boring, and sometimes they found it exciting. But they learned that I cared about these things, that I thought them important. In the same way, when they made a discovery I responded to what they thought was important.</p>

<p>Love grew as we opened up to each other; as we shared what mattered to us. It has been a privilege.</p>
