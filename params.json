They descend, exhausted, after the long night’s flight. A distant shot rings out. Hundreds rise in shifting eddies and swirls, sparkling in the sun like snow flurries on a windy day.\r\n\r\nThe willows are filled with warblers; their fall plumage of soft green, brown, gray and yellow feathers blends perfectly with the yellowing and browning leaves. We saw them everywhere on the way to the marsh – on telephone wires, in aspens and on cropped fields. Hungry, after a night’s flight of perhaps two hundred miles, they’re searching for grubs, insect eggs and cocoons.\r\n\r\n![Ducks] (http://www.public-domain-image.com/free-images/fauna-animals/birds/duck-mallard-pictures/redhead-drake-waterfowl-bird-aythya-americana-725x526.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
